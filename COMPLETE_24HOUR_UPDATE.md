## 🔢 **FRACTAL MATHEMATICS IN ACTION**

### Terrain Generation:
```
Height = Perlin noise + Fibonacci spiral
Mountains = Golden ratio (φ) peaks
Rivers = Logistic map curves
Trees = L-system fractals
Clouds = Mandelbrot set slices
```

### Goal Orb Positioning:
```
Angle = index × 137.5077640500378° (golden angle)
Distance = priority × φ (1.618...)
Height = (progress / 100) × Fibonacci[level]
Orbit = circular motion at φ rad/sec
```

### Character Movement:
```
Speed = energy_level × φ
Jump height = motivation × √φ
Animation timing = Fibonacci frame sequences
```

### Building Proportions:
```
Width/Height = φ
Window spacing = Fibonacci numbers
Door dimensions = φ ratio
Roof angles = golden angle
```
